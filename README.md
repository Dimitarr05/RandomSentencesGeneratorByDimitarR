# Random Sentences Generator

The goal of this project is to create a small Python program that generates random, entertaining sentences by combining predefined lists of names, places, verbs, nouns, adverbs, and details. It demonstrates basic programming concepts like functions, lists, and randomness

We solve the problem by using Python’s random.choice() function to pick elements from different word lists and then combine them into a sentence. The program loops infinitely, generating a new sentence every time the user presses Enter.
